# Post HashiStack Deployment Health Checks

## Smoke Test by Running a Simple Job

1. Check that you can access the Nomad console, to do this take the client ip address output from applying the terraform configuration and append ":4646" to the end of it.
   Past this into your browser address bar and you should see the following.

   Click on the link in the middle of the screen to log into the console directory using a token.

2. Supply the token string stored in the NOMAD_TOKEN environment variable ( ```export NOMAD_TOKEN=$(cat nomad.token)``` ):

3. Once logged in, you should be presented with this screen:

<img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://github.com/chrisadkin/Nomad-HashiStack-Lab/blob/main/png_images/03-nomad-console-logged-in.png?raw=true">

4. Currently there are no jobs running on your Nomad cluster, so lets create a simple Nomad job spec file:
```
$ nomad job init --short
```
   this will result in a file being created called example.nomad.hcl with the following contents:
```
job "example" {

  group "cache" {
    network {
      port "db" {
        to = 6379
      }
    }

    task "redis" {
      driver = "docker"

      config {
        image          = "redis:7"
        ports          = ["db"]
        auth_soft_fail = true
      }

      identity {
        env  = true
        file = true
      }

      resources {
        cpu    = 500
        memory = 256
      }
    }
  }
}
```   

6. Check what Nomad will do when the job is submitted:

```
$ nomad job plan example.nomad.hcl
```
   this should result in the following output:
```
+ Job: "example"
+ Task Group: "cache" (1 create)
  + Task: "redis" (forces create)

Scheduler dry-run:
- All tasks successfully allocated.

Job Modify Index: 0
To submit the job with version verification run:

nomad job run -check-index 0 example.nomad.hcl

When running the job with the check-index flag, the job will only be run if the
job modify index given matches the server-side version. If the index has
changed, another user has modified the job and the plan's results are
potentially invalid.
```

7. Submit the job:
```
nomad job run -check-index 0 example.nomad.hcl
```
   The resulting output should look like:
```

    2023-11-22T12:46:12Z: Evaluation triggered by job "example"

    ID          = 114e1dbd
    Job ID      = example
    Job Version = 0
    Status      = successful
    Description = Deployment completed successfully

```

8. Inspect the job in the Nomad console:

9. Click on 'example' the name of the job to view it in greater detail:
